759506712516784128	realDonaldTrump	Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?	2016-07-31 00:51:25
759507812963737600	realDonaldTrump	#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql	2016-07-31 00:55:48

748599094252273664	realDonaldTrump	One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD	2016-06-30 22:28:27
748599438034206720	realDonaldTrump	The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!	2016-06-30 22:29:48

673299830094057472	realDonaldTrump	.@KatyTurNBC, 3rd rate reporter &amp; @SopanDeb @ CBS lied. Finished in normal manner&amp;signed autos for 20min. Dishonest! https://t.co/sCglbQjB3o	2015-12-06 02:36:03
673300588654927872	realDonaldTrump	@Maddow, you copied incompetent @KatyTurNBC incorrect story. I'm sure you would like to apologize to me on show. Thank you for the courtesy.	2015-12-06 02:39:04
673300749649059842	realDonaldTrump	@Pimpburgh2015: @KatyTurNBC @realDonaldTrump just tweeted that you are a third rate reporter. That's only because I'm being nice!	2015-12-06 02:39:42

733597831261499392	realDonaldTrump	Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!	2016-05-20 12:58:47
733600358501625857	realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!	2016-05-20 13:08:49

733604767612710912	realDonaldTrump	Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary. Four more years of this? No way!	2016-05-20 13:26:20
